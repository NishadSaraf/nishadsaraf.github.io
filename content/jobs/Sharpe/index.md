Worked on designing, developing, and integrating a market-ready control system to remotely control and monitor solar tracking assembly.

- Developed an open-source control platform to track the location of the sun based on different sensor data extracted locally.
- Translated given requirements to an actual working prototype. That includes researching appropriate MCU and sensors to accomplish a given set of specifications.
- Interfaced WiFi chip to send/receive critical alert messages during extreme weather conditions. During normal operation, the current state of the solar panel and sensor data was logged on a remote server.
- Improved the existing system with more reliable and scalable solutions. One such example was the time tracking methodology, the dependency on the GPS module was replaced with a more reliable RTC module with a 30% improvement in performance.
- Customized vendor-supplied drivers to achieve the required output and performance.
- Assisted in designing a PCB layout for the control system. The PCB accommodates the MCU along with different sensors, encoders, and relay circuitry.
