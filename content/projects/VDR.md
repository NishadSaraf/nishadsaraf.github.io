Developed a real-time monitor for a vehicle, on Arduino Mega 2560(AT mega 328) board. The VDR records various statistics such as speed, distance traveled, fuel
capacity, location information, collision detection etc. and stores this information on MMC/ SD card.

Implemented a routine on vehicle crash, such that the system sends accident alert SMS and the current position of the vehicle to a preprogrammed mobile number
via GSM modem
