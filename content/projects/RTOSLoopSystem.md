Implemented a full PID controller for an electric motor with and without load. Created a custom IP for interfacing PmodHBridge with Nexys FPGA.

Wrote device drivers for peripheral used which includes PmodHbridge, PmodOLED display, and PmodENC rotary encoder.

Synthesized hardware for PWM generation and edge detection, for driving the motor and to obtain the actual speed from the pulses generated by Hall effect sensor respectively. AXI bus interface was used to communicate data between the HW blocks and Microblaze CPU.

Created a multithreaded PID control application that runs on a lightweight real-time operating system “Xilkernel” using IPC mechanisms like semaphore and message queue.
