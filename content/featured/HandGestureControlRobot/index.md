Designed an algorithm in Python using OpenCV libraries to detect the number of fingers present in real-time within a predefined contour. Devised a fast control system on Xilinx Nexys 4 DDR board, which generates control signals based on the hand gestures captured in real-time. Established UART communication between laptop and Nexys board to deliver proper information based on the hand gesture. Ported MIPS based Arduino core to Xilinx Nexys4DDR FPGA board and made use of Bridge libraries to virtually map the pins of the robot
